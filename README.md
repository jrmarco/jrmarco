# Hi there 👋

I'm Marco (Jrmarco) a developer from 🍕Italy.    
Born in Roma as "urban gladiator", now based in Siracusa as "Sǐcāni scholar" 😄   
I like to code, play games ( ♟️/🎮 board & videogame [PC] ), enjoy a nice 🍺 beer.   
I'm also a 👶father, a wannabe 🎸guitar player, a ✈️traveller and a lot of other things.   
_I do use the Developer Tools on the right side of the screen 👀_ 
    
I'm happy to join (coding) adventures or help you with solutions. Drop me a line
